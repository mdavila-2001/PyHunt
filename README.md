<h1>Python Duck Hunt</h1>

This was a project I did while still in high school, the objective was to recreate a classic game using Python.

The game of my choice was [Duck Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) which was released in 1984/1985/1987 (Japan/US/Europe) for 
NES console.

<h3>Objective</h3>
For my game I added a little twist to it, the goal of the game is simple, shoot as many ducks as possible using the least amount of shots in the time provided to you.

<h3>Game Play and Controls</h3>
Controls for this game are extremely simple, simply use the mouse to move the cursor around on the screen.

P - Pause and unpause the game

Left Mouse Click - Shoot


The game gives you one minute to shoot as many ducks, at the end you will see your accuracy and the number of ducks that you successfully hit.

<h3>Duck Point Value</h3>
There are three colors of ducks, and they range in point value.

![Black Duck](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwrouse/Python_DuckHunt/master/Sprites/black/duck1.png) Black Duck - 75 points

![Blue Duck](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwrouse/Python_DuckHunt/master/Sprites/blue/duck1.png) Blue Duck - 25 points

<h3>Requirements</h3>
This game requires you to have [Python 3.4.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/) installed on your computer, and it will run on any computer with [Python 3.4.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/) installed on it.

Along with PyGame and Python you will need to install the LiveWires python module, to do this go to the "Installs/Livewires" folder in this repository and run the "setup.bat" file if you are on Windows. If you're running a version of Linux you should be able to just run the "setup.py" file.

You will also need to download the correct version of [PyGame](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads) for your operating system.
